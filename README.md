# PromanNg

This is a personal project, aimed at practicing building Angular apps. The app provides basic functionalities of a kanban board app (like Trello). The app is built in Angular on the front end, and uses cloud no-sql database solution provided by Firebase. I'm also using the app to practice testing using Karma and Jasmine. I'm regularly adding new features to the app.

## Implemented functionalities

* User can create account and login
* User can create and review personal boards
* User can CRUD lists with statuses
* User can create, review and delete cards with tasks
* Using drag & drop user can switch order of cards, as well as lists with statuses

## Technologies used

* Angular 8. 
* Angular-Material
* Cloud Firestore
* Angular-fire
* Karma / Jasmine

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
